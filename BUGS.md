# Known issues

Tracked bugs and rough edges. Newest first. When filing one, note how to reproduce it
and how severe it is so it can be prioritized against the roadmap.

Format:

```
### <id> — <short title>   [open|fixed]   severity: low|medium|high
Repro: <the shortest reliable way to trigger it>
Notes: <cause, workaround, or fix once known>
```

---

### 2 — a non-ASCII title is stored and delivered as mojibake   [open]   severity: medium
Repro: publish a title with an accent, then read the message back.

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-Title: Café déjà vu" \
     -d "hello" http://127.0.0.1:4500/mytopic
{"id":"…","topic":"mytopic","title":"CafÃ© dÃ©jÃ  vu","message":"hello",…}
```

Notes: Node decodes request header values as latin1 — one character per byte received —
so the two bytes of a UTF-8 `é` arrive as the two characters `Ã©`, and that is what is
persisted and streamed to subscribers. The body is unaffected: it is read as UTF-8.

A fix is `Buffer.from(value, 'latin1').toString('utf8')` on `X-Title` and `X-Tags`, but
what a client is expected to send should be settled first — raw UTF-8 bytes, or RFC 2047
encoded words — because a lone latin1 title (`Café` sent as one 0xE9 byte) decodes to a
replacement character under either reading. Bounding the headers by their *received*
bytes (256 for a title) is unaffected by this and stays correct either way.

### 1 — the built server cannot start   [fixed]   severity: high
Repro: `pnpm -C server build && pnpm -C server start`

```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '.../server/dist/app'
imported from .../server/dist/server.js
```

Notes: the package is `"type": "module"`, so Node's ESM loader needs a file extension on
every relative import. `tsconfig.json` set `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"`, which let
the source write `from './app'` and emitted it unchanged, so nothing resolved at runtime.
Only the compiled output was affected — `pnpm dev` (tsx) and `pnpm test` (vitest) resolve
extensionless imports themselves, which is why the suite was green.

This broke the documented deployment: `deploy/commlink-server.service` runs
`node dist/server.js`.

Fixed by switching the build to `"moduleResolution": "NodeNext"` and writing `./app.js` in
every relative import. NodeNext also *rejects* an extensionless relative import at compile
time, so `pnpm typecheck` now fails on the mistake rather than deferring it to runtime.
`pnpm smoke` (a new CI step) starts the compiled server and checks `/healthz`, because
neither typecheck nor the test suite loads `dist/`.
